# PSR-16 Cache Utilities

This package contains a series of traits and base classes to cover the common,
boilerplate portions of implementing a PSR-16-compliant cache library.

This package does not, and will not, provide a complete production-ready PSR-16
implementation.  If you are looking for a PSR-16 implementation, consult your
friendly local Packagist.org server.
